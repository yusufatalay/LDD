## Linux Device Driver Exploration on BeagleBone Black

This project explores various Linux device driver development approaches for the BeagleBone Black single-board computer. It emphasizes user-space interaction techniques and leverages the device tree and sysfs mechanisms.

**Implemented Drivers:**

* **Pseudo Character Device Driver:** A fundamental driver providing a basic user-space interface.
* **Pseudo Character Platform Driver:** Utilizes the platform bus framework for more advanced interactions.
* **Pseudo Character Device Tree and Overlay:** Defines and configures the device node using the device tree and overlays.
* **Pseudo Character Device sysfs:** Exposes attributes and functionalities through the sysfs filesystem.
* **GPIO sysfs for BeagleBone Black:** Demonstrates control and interaction with GPIO pins via sysfs.

**Project Benefits:**

* **Hands-on Learning:** Practical experience with different Linux device driver development concepts.
* **Driver Framework Understanding:** Explores platform bus and device tree mechanisms for driver configuration.
* **User-Space Interaction:** Showcases techniques for exposing driver functionalities to user-space applications using sysfs.
* **BeagleBone Black Expertise:** Deepens understanding of the BeagleBone Black's hardware and software architecture.

**Technical Skills Highlighted:**

* **Linux Device Driver Development:** Proficiency in writing and implementing Linux device drivers.
* **Device Tree and Overlay Knowledge:** Understanding of device tree structure and overlays for driver configuration.
* **sysfs Interfacing:** Ability to expose driver functionalities through the sysfs filesystem.
* **BeagleBone Black Hardware Interaction:** Knowledge of the BeagleBone Black's GPIO capabilities and sysfs control.
